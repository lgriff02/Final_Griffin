    				<p class="lead">In October 2021, the National Hockey League commenced the first (hopefully) fully normal season since 2018-19. The 82-game schedule and the  full capacity crowds are back. In the 2018-19 season, many factors contributed to how often a team's arena was flooded with fans every night. </p>

							<h3>Introduction</h3>
							<p>As Gordon Bombay said in <i>The Mighty Ducks 2</i>, “Hockey should be fun”. “Fun” incorporates every aspect of the game: the games themselves, practice, postgame press conferences, pregame suits, road trips, and, most of all, the fans. Unfortunately, on March 12, 2020, the NHL suspended operations due to COVID-19. With that suspension, all those aspects were gone. The hockey world was dormant, until August 1, 2020. Every aspect of the game returned except for one: fans. Due to ongoing concerns of the virus, all games were played in one of two centralized “bubble” locations in Toronto or Edmonton. No fans were allowed. As the next season began a few months later and vaccine rollout progressed, teams began to welcome fans back progressively- open at limited capacity to start then gradually expand- with many US teams holding playoff games in June at or near full capacity. When the 2021-22 season opened, all 32 NHL teams were at full capacity. The last normal regular season to be completed with fans was 2018-19. The data from that season identifies trends as to what draws fans to games, whether it be number of tickets sold by the team, an arena’s capacity, team success, or market size.</p>

					<h3>Standing room tickets and lower capacities</h3>
					<p>One of the biggest changes to NHL venues in recent years has been the addition of standing room tickets. Standing room tickets allow teams to sell more tickets than there are seats, and 8 teams thrived from it. The Chicago Blackhawks, Vegas Golden Knights, Minnesota Wild, Philadelphia Flyers, Toronto Maple Leafs, Nashville Predators, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Washington Capitals all had average attendance numbers higher than their arena’s capacity (ESPN). Standing room tickets aren’t that appealing to all fans though.</p>
					<p>“For a regular season game, I would not purchase a standing room ticket,” says Sam Oppenheim, ESPN production assistant and hockey fan. “But, if the game merits it, like in the case of a Stanley Cup Final, I would buy one.” Despite this perspective, Oppenheim thinks this recent trend isn’t stopping anytime soon.</p>
					<p>“I think teams are willing to increase supply if the demand is there,” Oppenheim said. “They’re definitely going to provide the opportunity for people to stand if they want.” </p>
					<p>Standing room tickets provide the opportunity for a team to fill their arena past capacity. It’s something the New York Islanders should have considered in 2018-19. Their arena had far and away the lowest capacity of any NHL team, naturally they had fewer fans than every other team in the NHL. </p>

					<h3>Team Success</h3>
					<p>One factor that determines whether fans are willing to stand for their team: team success. Just ask the Tampa Bay Lightning. In 2018-19, the Lightning compiled 128 points in the regular season, the highest since 1996. All 41 of the Lightning’s home games were filled to the brink. There was never an empty seat. The Boston Bruins, who were tied for the second highest point total in the NHL, also sold out every home game. On the flip side of the spectrum, the Ottawa Senators, who had the lowest point total in the NHL, had the 3rd-worst attendance numbers. </p>

					<h3>Big Market bias... or not?</h3>
					<p>Often, fans from the largest markets in America have the most passionate fanbases. However, the data shows mixed results in that regard. New York City is considered the biggest market in America, and with that the NHL. So much so that the Big Apple boasts 2 teams: the Islanders and the Rangers. However, neither of their attendance numbers are exactly eye-popping. In 2018-19, the Islanders played at far and away the smallest arena in the NHL by # of seats. The seats also weren’t exactly full from game to game, as the building was just 89.5% full on average, fifth worst in the league. On the other hand, the Rangers play at Madison Square Garden, otherwise known as “The World’s Most Famous Arena”. Despite that, they couldn’t sell out every game, and their attendance numbers are right in the middle of the pack. On the flip side, Edmonton, Alberta is the third smallest market in the NHL behind Winnipeg and Buffalo. However, all their home games in 2018-19 sold out. There’s the disproven theory: while market size is often important, and it’s very prevalent when it comes to financial resources among other things, it doesn’t necessarily determine how packed an arena is on a given night. </p>

					<h3>A full circle view</h3>
					<p> So, what does this all mean and why is it important? Two months ago, all 32 NHL arenas opened at full capacity, and assuming the pandemic doesn’t worsen to the point where things need to shut down again, an 82-game schedule with fans in every building is set to proceed. The attendance data from the 2018-19 season can be used to make predictions about the numbers we might see as the season goes on… partially. One factor in the 2021-22 season is something that was nonexistent in 2018-19: cabin fever. </p>
					<p> “I think attendance will be higher because of the return,” Oppenheim said. “People want to get out of the house and hockey is a fun way to do that”.</p>
					<p>As mentioned earlier, teams based in the United States were able to open at or near full capacity as playoffs arrived. The US’ northern border didn’t have that luxury, and it makes the effect much larger.</p>
					<p> “Teams in Canada, they waited longer than the other teams,” Oppenheim notes, “they’ve kind of seen a real boost this year, from an emotional standpoint too.” </p>
					<p> As fans returned to arenas across the US, the longing for a taste of normalcy was clear. Canada had to wait even longer for that normalcy, and early-season renditions of <i> O Canada</i> were among the loudest they’ve ever been.</p>
					<p> Overall, an uptick in attendance is expected because hockey fans across the world have been stuck in the house for a long time. But who does the best will be determined by how many tickets are sold- expect arenas with standing room to continue to prevail- team success- expect rising teams like the Florida Panthers to see an uptick and falling teams like the Philadelphia Flyers to see a slide. But there are so many intangibles the data does not take into account, such as the cabin fever from COVID-19, big market bias, or the new arena the New York Islanders now call home. The point is is that hockey is back, fans are back, and it’s up to each respective team to utilize it to their advantage.
